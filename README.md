# CS6760: Privacy, Security, and Usability

**Course Overview**

You are an owner of a successful start-up, providing a service where your system continuously monitors various health and activity information about your customer, in order to better manage the customer’s chronic health condition. Your business relies on cloud computing technologies, mobile devices, and recent developments in artificial intelligence.

As a part of your business, you collect throws of data about your customers. The data that you collect, mine and guard is valuable – without it, your business doesn’t exist. However, the data is also highly sensitive (e.g., it consists of patients’ biomedical, activity, location information, collected over an extended period of time)! So, even though you are only planning to use that data for legitimate purposes (and you are never planning to abuse it), you need to understand how such data may be misused, and by whom. More importantly, you need to understand what your responsibilities are, and what are technical approaches that you can implement in order to use the data only as intended.

This course surveys recent privacy approaches, applicable to various technical disciplines. In doing so, the course explores privacy threats arising from recent advancements in data mining and artificial intelligence. We will briefly discuss the history of privacy, and compare major privacy legal frameworks (such as GDPR and CCPA). We will then explore the phenomena of unravelling of privacy and inverse privacy. Next, we will survey several privacy design frameworks. We will then explore privacy-preserving techniques, such as anonymization, differential privacy, and polymorphic encryption.

**Labs:**

We will have five Python-based lab assignments, intended to give you experience with some simple data mining and privacy engineering techniques. The labs will utilize publicly available data sets.
